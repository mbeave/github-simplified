# GitHub Simplified

This app simplifies access to GitHub projects for non-technical users. Just enter a GitHub URL of a repository you would like simplified (you'll find it in the address bar and its something that looks like this: https://github.com/mbeave/github-simplified). 

It will then present a download button for the project and present its readme or instructions for installing and using it. 

This hopefully reduces some of the clutter and makes it easy to download and use useful open source projects for people who are not as familiar with GitHub.

### Built with React, TailwindCSS, and Vite.
